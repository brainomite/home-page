Like my cover Image? Want to use any two fonts with one being italic only?

I took some content from [An alternative to Operator Mono font](https://medium.com/@docodemore/an-alternative-to-operator-mono-font-6e5d040e1c7e)
and [Multiple Fonts: Alternative to Operator Mono in VSCode](https://medium.com/@docodemore/an-alternative-to-operator-mono-font-6e5d040e1c7e)
then modified and added some steps.
