I'm going to demonstrate two font and several themes with those fonts in coding
use.

## Fonts

The two fonts used in this post are [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)
and [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/).

### Ligatures

There is this concept of coding fonts with two major benefits.
They are mono-spaced, meaning every character is the same width.
But the main draw is that they support coding [ligatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthographic_ligature#Programming_languages).

Comparison of Fira Code with and without ligatures enabled.

JetBrains Mono doesn't have as many ligatures as Fira Code
