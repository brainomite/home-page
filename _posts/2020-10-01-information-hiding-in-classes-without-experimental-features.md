  I explain how to hide internal functions and variables that will not be available by the consumer

I had a friend tell me the other day that they figured out how to use an API.
What they explained to me is they created that they created the class object as
required, but then they were manipulating properties and / or using functions
that were prefixed with the `_` character. As you may or may not know, it is a
convention in JS prefix properties on objects with a `_` to indicate that the
variables/functions are for internal use only.

There happens to be a [stage 3 proposal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Private_class_fields) for private class variables, which is considered experimental, and I won't be delving into it here. Even
though it reached stage 3 in July 2017 it hasn't been implemented widely yet,
for example, Firefox hasn't as per [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_classes_private_class_fields).
As of ES2021 specification has been finalized, we'll be waiting at least another
year before, or if, it is added to final specs.

I believe that this implicit contract isn't always sufficient and it isn't
defensive programming. People, like my friend, can and do break the implicit
contract when consuming a library. I have come up with a way to encapsulate
private variables and functions that won't be accessible by the consumers.
For my purposes, I needed instance variables.

Below I've created two examples that are functionally the same, albeit the first
example will have additional properties, but the contract is, no one should use
or modify it. In the second example, I used [Object.defineProperty()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty) a cool function that, as its clever name indicates, defines a
property on an object. You can define, setters, getters, and normal class
variables (that can be any variable, object, or function). You can also specify
whether a class variable is writable. I encourage you to read the documentation on it, and it's sibling function [Object.defineProperties()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperties).


### example 1 - Contract

```js
class ContractSecretKeeper {
  constructor(secret, password) {
    // No one should touch or examine this because we have a contract
    // that these are internal variables, and not to be relied upon.
    // Sadly I'm still publicly available.
    this._secret = secret;
    this._password = password;
  }

  getSecret(password) {
    if (password === this._password) {
      return this._secret;
    } else {
      throw new Error("password incorrect");
    }
  }

  set password(newPassword) {
    this._password = newPassword;
    // no no no, you can't get the secret now!
    this._secret = "";
  }

  get password() {
    throw new Error("password access denied");
  }

  set secret(newSecret) {
    this._secret = newSecret;
  }

  get secret() {
    throw new Error("I'll never give up the secret, even if you torture me");
  }
}
const badSecretKeeper = new ContractSecretKeeper("I stole some cookies", "cookieMonster");

console.log(badSecretKeeper); //=> {_secret: "I stole some cookies", _password: "cookieMonster"}
console.log(badSecretKeeper.getSecret("cookieMonster")); //=> I stole some cookies
console.log(badSecretKeeper._password); //=> cookieMonster
console.log(badSecretKeeper._secret); //=> I stole some cookies
```

### 2 Truly hidden data

```js
function functionGenerator(secret, password) {
  // super secret variables available via closure
  let _secret = secret;
  let _password = password;

  return {
    getSecret: (password) => {
      if (password === _password) {
        return _secret;
      } else {
        throw new Error("password incorrect");
      }
    },
    passwordSetter: (newPassword) => {
      _password = newPassword;
      // Just because you now know the password by changing it
      // I still ain't gonna tell you!
      _secret = "";
    },
    secretSetter: (newSecret) => {
      _secret = newSecret;
    },
  };
}

class PrivateSecretKeeper {
  constructor(secret, password) {
    const { passwordSetter, secretSetter, getSecret } = functionGenerator(
      secret,
      password
    );

    // lets put the functions that closed over the secret variables
    // onto 'this'
    this.getSecret = getSecret;
    Object.defineProperty(this, "password", { set: passwordSetter });
    Object.defineProperty(this, "secret", { set: secretSetter });
  }

  get password() {
    throw new Error("password access denied");
  }

  get secret() {
    throw new Error("I'll never give up the secret, even if you torture me");
  }
}

const superSecretKeeper = new PrivateSecretKeeper(
  "I stole some cookies",
  "cookieMonster"
);

console.log(superSecretKeeper); //=> {getSecret: Æ’}
console.log(superSecretKeeper.getSecret("cookieMonster")); //=> I stole some cookies
console.log(superSecretKeeper._secret); //=> undefined
console.log(superSecretKeeper._password); //=> undefined
```
