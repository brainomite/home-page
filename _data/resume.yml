  # summary: >
  #   Richard hails from Tulsa.
  #   He has earned degrees from the University of Oklahoma and Stanford. (Go Sooners and Cardinals!)
  #   Before starting Pied Piper, he worked for Hooli as a part time software developer.
  #   While his work focuses on applied information theory,
  #   mostly optimizing lossless compression schema of both the length-limited and adaptive variants,
  #   his non-work interests range widely,
  #   everything from quantum computing to chaos theory.
  #   He could tell you about it, but THAT would NOT be a “length-limited” conversation!
